## Task 6 - Finding Neutron damage using cell tallies and stochastic volume calculations

Please allow X minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation]().

Short task description?

Maybe put a small list of instructions to what notebooks to use?

Maybe put learning outcomes here too??

**Learning Outcomes**

- Finding damage energy deposited with the OpenMC MT 444 tally
- Find the volume of a cell using the stochastic volume method
- Perform post tally calculations to convert the neutronics numbers into something more useful
- Gain an appreciation of how neutronics results can influence the design (e.g. radius of reactor must be increased to prevent critical material damage)
