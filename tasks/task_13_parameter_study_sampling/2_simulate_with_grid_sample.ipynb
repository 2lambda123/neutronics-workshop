As a result, grid sampling is a highly efficient sampling technique for covering a parameter space."

    "However, as simulations are performed in order according to the defined grid, they are biased towards the first parameter values in the grid, I.e. they are biased towards one area of parameter space. For example, the code abbove performs simulations with breeder percent in breeder plus multiplier ratio = 0 for all Li6 enrichments before breeder percent in breeder plus multiplier ratio is changed. This means that all simulations across the grid must be performed before a data trend across the entire parameter space can be observed. This is the main disadvantage of grid sampling as more simulations than are necessary may be performed, and it is difficult to efficiently add sample points to the existing data without performing a complete new grid search 'in-between' the existing data points. On the other hand, random sampling is unbiased meaning the data trend across the parameter space can be observed with a small number of simulations and additional sample points can be added easily."

    "Overall, grid sampling is a more efficient sampling technique than random sampling, but its bias towards initial parameter values makes it unsuitable for most applications. Instead, we tend to use more advanced 'quasi-random' or 'adaptive' techniques to improve sampling efficiency."
