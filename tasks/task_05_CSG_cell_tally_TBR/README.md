## Task 5 - Finding TBR with Cell tallies

Please allow X minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation]().

Short task description?

Maybe put a small list of instructions to what notebooks to use?

Maybe put learning outcomes here too??

**Learning Outcomes**

- Finding TBR with OpenMC.
- Introduction to MT reaction numbers. e.g. (n,Xt) = 205.
- Simple methods of increasing the TBR using lithium enrichment.
- Improving the uncertainty on the result is possible with more computation.
