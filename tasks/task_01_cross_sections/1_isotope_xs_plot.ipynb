    "Knowing the interaction probabilities of isotopes and materials in your model can help you understand simulation results. There are several online tools for plotting nuclear cross sections such as [www.xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com), however, OpenMC can also plot cross sections.\n",

    "Microscopic cross section is the effective target area in $\\mathrm{m}^2$ presented by a single nucleus to an incident neutron beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used to characterize the probability of reaction between a neutron and an individual nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microscopic is often stated in units of barns where 1 barn is equal to $10^{−28}$ $\\mathrm{m}^2$ "
