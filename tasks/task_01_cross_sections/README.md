## Task 1 - Cross sections

Please allow X minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation]().

Short task description?

Maybe put a small list of instructions to what notebooks to use?

Maybe put learning outcomes here too??

**Learning Outcomes**

- How OpenMC can be used to plot cross-sectional data for a variety of fusion-relevant interactions, e.g. (n,2n), (n,Xt). 
- Reaction probabilities vary for each isotope depending on the energy of the neutron. 
- Cross sections can be plotted for specific isotopes, elements and full materials. 
- Beryllium 9 has the lowest threshold energy for neutron multiplication reactions. 
- Lithium 6 has the highest probability of producing tritium at low neutron energies.
- Understand that lithium enrichment increases tritium production from low energy neutrons.
