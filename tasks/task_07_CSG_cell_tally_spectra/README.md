## Task 7 - Finding neutron and photon spectra using cell tallies

Please allow X minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation]().

Short task description?

Maybe put a small list of instructions to what notebooks to use?

Maybe put learning outcomes here too??

**Learning Outcomes**

- Plotting neutron / photon spectra for cells and surfaces and observing the changing neutron energy at different locations in the reactor.
- Performing coupled neutron photon simulations where photons are created from neutron interactions.
- Understand that longer simulations are need to improve results in some cases.
