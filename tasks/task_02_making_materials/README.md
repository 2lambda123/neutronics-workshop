## Task 2 - Making materials

Please allow X minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are in the [presentation]().

Short task description?

Maybe put a small list of instructions to what notebooks to use?

Maybe put learning outcomes here too??


(Note: A density parameter study like this is not possible using in-built OpenMC functions as material densities must be specified explicitly.)

### Learning Outcomes

- You are able to make materials from an original specification that could be isotope fractions, element fractions or materials fractions for a mixed material.

- Understand that density varies for materials as a function of pressure, temperture, enrichment and mixture fraction.
