## Task 3 - Making CSG geometry

Please allow X minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation]().

Short task description?

Maybe put a small list of instructions to what notebooks to use?

Maybe put learning outcomes here too??

OpenMC can provide both 2D and 3D visualizations of the Constructive Solid Geometry ([CSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)) of a model.

There are two methods for producing 2D slice views of model geometries. This can be done via a Python Matplotlib (```1_example_geometry_viewer_2d.py```) or via the production of xml files, again with Python (```2_example_geometry_viewer_2d_xml_version.py```). The first option is simpler to understand and use while the second option is slightly faster for complex geometries, we will use the simpler option in this workshop.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Construction of simple Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) geometry.
- Visualisation of models using 2D slices.
- Visualisation of models using 3D cube geometry.
